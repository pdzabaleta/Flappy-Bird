# Flappy Bird (C++ & SFML)

A high-performance Flappy Bird clone built with **C++** and **SFML**. This project focuses on precise physics and optimized collision detection.

## 🚀 Features
- **Precise Collision Engine:** Uses a custom circle-to-rectangle collision algorithm to ensure fair gameplay and eliminate "invisible walls."
- **Physics-Based Movement:** Smooth gravity and jump mechanics with bird rotation based on velocity.
- **Score System:** Real-time score tracking and High Score persistence during the session.
- **Pixel Art Assets:** Integrated custom sprites and a retro-style pixel font.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- **SFML 2.6.x**
- **C++17** or higher
- **Xcode** (for macOS users)

## 🎮 Controls
- **[SPACE]**: Jump / Start Game / Restart after Game Over.
- **[CLOSE WINDOW]**: Exit the game.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: Core game logic and rendering loop.
- `bird.png`: Player sprite.
- `pipe.png`: Obstacle sprite.
- `font.ttf`: Retro/Pixel typography.
